Social media dashboard with theme switch

The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The tools I used were HTML, SCSS and Javascript. That last one was required for the color theme toggle.

Thw users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
